# LipReader.AI
An advanced lipreader built using deep learning techniques and advanced feature extraction (implementation of LIpNet paper)

 The lip reader model built using deep learning and advanced feature extraction techniques. Dubbed as LipReader.AI , the project is an implementation of the paper LipNet authored by researchers at Cornell University. With slight changes to its architecture (used Bi-LSTM instead of Bi-GRU) and a quantized dataset , the model showed promising results during testing.
